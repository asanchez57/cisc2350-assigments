	<h2>Where I Work</h2>

	<p> I have been a member of the Inwood Community Services (ICS) family since I was a teenager. I started working there since I was 16 years old.  I am proud of the work that the ICS agency accomplishes because of the impact that it has on my community. The ICS is a not for profit organiziation which focuses on providing free mental health services and substances abuse threatment for under priveleged community memebers. In addition, ICS also has a program which provides summer youth employment and after school efforts for elementery school kids.</p>

	 <h2>How does ICS Survive?</h2>

	<p>ICS has been able to survive for years due to some state and government funding. Most of the grant received by ICS are typically DYCD grants and donation from people of the community.
