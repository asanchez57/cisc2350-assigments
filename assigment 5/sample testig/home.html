	<h2>Where i work</h2>

	<p> I have been a member of the ics family since i was a teenager. I started working there since I was 16 years old.  i am proud of the work that the iCS agency accomplishes because of the impact that it has in my community. the ics or Inwood Community Services is a nonfor profit organiziation which focuses on providing free mental health services and substances abuse threatment for under priveleged community memebers. in addition, the Ics agency also has a program which provides summer youth employment and after school efforts for elementery school kids.</p>

	 <h4>How does ics is able to do this</h4>

	<p>Ics have been able to survive for years due to some state and government funding. Most of the grant received by ics are typicly DYCD grants and donation from people of the community. For more information about Ics please click on the right link call work!.</p>
